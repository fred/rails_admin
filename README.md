RailsAdmin
==========
RailsAdmin is a Rails engine that provides an easy-to-use interface for managing your data.

This is a fork of [RailsAdmin](https://github.com/sferik/rails-admin) for Rails 3 that removes images_path links 
so it will not conflict with images_controller.

It's a very small patch, since rails 3.0 is not supported by rails_amdin.
